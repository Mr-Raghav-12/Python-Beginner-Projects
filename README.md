# Project 1: Username Creator

In this project, I created a simple **Username Creator**. The program:

- Uses the `sep` parameter to add an underscore (`_`) between the first name and last name.
- Uses `\"` to include quotation marks in strings.
- Implements a simple `random` function to generate a random number and append it to the username.

It's a simple yet useful project, perfect for beginners to practice concepts like string formatting, random number generation, and escape sequences.
